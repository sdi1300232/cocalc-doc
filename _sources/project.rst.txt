Projects
========================

The concept of a "Project" is the fundamental building block for running any calculations on CoCalc.
It is an isolated, private working space, where you work with files organized in directories.
(Under the hood, this is a Linux environment, running in a Docker container.)

To start being productive, you have to create a :doc:`sagews`, :doc:`jupyter`, :doc:`terminal` or other files like :doc:`latex`.
