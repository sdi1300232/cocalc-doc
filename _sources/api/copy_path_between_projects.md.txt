# copy_path_between_projects

* ``id``: A unique UUID for the query
* ``src_project_id``: id of source project (required)
* ``src_path``: relative path of directory or file in the source project (required)
* ``target_project_id``: id of target project (required)
* ``target_path``: defaults to src_path
* ``overwrite_newer``: overwrite newer versions of file at destination (destructive) (default: false)
* ``delete_missing``: delete files in dest that are missing from source (destructive) (default: false)
* ``backup``: make ~ backup files instead of overwriting changed files (default: false)
* ``timeout``: seconds to wait before reporting "error" (though copy could still succeed)
* ``exclude_history``: if true, exclude all files of the form `*.sage-history` (default: false)

Copy a file or directory from one project to another. User must be
owner or collaborator on both projects.

Note: the `timeout` option is passed to a call to the `rsync` command.
If no data is transferred for the specified number of seconds, then
the copy terminates. The default is 0, which means no timeout.

Relative paths (paths not beginning with '/') are relative to the user's
home directory in source and target projects.

Example:

Copy file `A/doc.txt` from source project to target project.
Folder `A` will be created in target project if it does not exist already.
